owning securities and investments  pelosi  act on jan       after news broke that pelosis venture capitalist husband sold        shares of google stock just one month before the tech giant was sued

congress  which failed to get a single cosponsor  but theres another very similar bill in congress that stands more of a chance of passing because of its bipartisan support  on jan      reps  abigail spanberger of virginia and chip roy of texas  joined by a bipartisan alliance of    co sponsors  reintroduced the transparent representation upholding service and trust in congress act  or trust  for the third time   we saw tremendous momentum  we saw growing support in our districts  and we saw growing recognition across the political spectrum that such a reform needs to be made now   spanberger

address the advantage that politicians have as well connected people with the inside track on new legislation that might affect a company or an industry   while wall street and big tech work hand in hand with elected officials to enrich each other  hard working americans pay the price   hawley said in his pelosi act announcement   the solution is clear  we must immediately and permanently ban all members of congress from trading stocks   while insider insights dont make them clairvoyant  its certainly an advantage when it comes to trading in the stock market  a survey  commissioned by conservative advocacy group convention of states action last year  showed that more than     of voters believe lawmakers have an unfair advantage when trading   and those feelings arent unfounded

financial trades as they are mandated to do by the stop trading on congressional knowledge act of       but an even larger investigation from the wall street journal revealed thousands of washington officials are taking part in ethically gray trading  pelosi and trust would aim to reduce that by requiring senior officials and others affected by the bill to either sell their holdings when they take their position in congress or put them into a blind trust  where they would have no control over the trades  they would still  however  be able to purchase diversified etfs  diversified mutual funds  and u s  treasury bills  notes or bonds   the american people are tired of seeing members of congress making pretty significant profits while theyre voting on the very policies that affect the corporations theyre meeting with on a regular basis   roy told fox business  despite being targeted for alleged insider trading  even pelosi has championed a bill trying to tackle the problem in congress   the bill introduced by democrats  htt ps   moneywise com news investing democrats introduce bill against stock trading  last september  called the combating financial conflicts of interest in government act  also aimed to limit investing conflicts of interest for politicians and their families  however  that bill was heavily criticized by both sides of the house for lacking teeth and including a built in loophole around the blind trust requirement  with more co sponsors than ever before  spanberger and roys trust currently stands the best chance of passing and rebuilding trust with the american public   we need to do something to stop that breach of trust that is apparent to the american people that we seem to be day trading while were supposed to be doing the work of the american people   roy said in an interview with fox business   hold onto your money   jeff bezos says you might want to rethink buying a  new automobile  refrigerator  or whatever    here are   better

Billionaire Adani's Empire Loses $51 Billion in 48 Hours,https://www.thestreet.com/technology/billionaire-adanis-empire-loses-51-billion-in-48-hours?puc=yahoo&cm_ven=YAHOO&yptr=yahoo,     2023-01-28,suspicion is creating chaos in the empire built by the indian billionaire gautam adani  who since last year has become the richest man in asia   adani      saw his fortune jump by more than     billion last year  according to the bloomberg billionaires index  while the fortunes of a number of tech billionaires were melting  this leap propelled him into the elite holders of the world s biggest fortunes    he managed to rank as the second richest person behind elon musk  tesla s ceo  he fell back to finish the year in third place  and he s currently the fourth richest person in the world with a net wealth valued at      billion as of jan      according to the bloomberg billionaires index   now  as he tries to establish himself on the world stage  observers can expect his wealth to dwindle further  that s because for the past two days he s been caught up in what appears to be a nightmare  the new york investment firm hindenburg research has announced that it shorted stocks of the andani conglomerate through u s  traded bonds and non indian traded derivative instruments   this means that hindenburg research  a well known short seller  is betting on a short term drop in the prices of these equities   the short seller explains that the bet stems from alleged illegal practices on the part of the indian tycoon s conglomerate   we have uncovered evidence of brazen accounting fraud  stock manipulation and money laundering at adani  taking place over the course of decades   hindenburg wrote in a report    adani has pulled off this gargantuan feat with the help of enablers in government and a cottage industry of international companies that facilitate these activities   the report describes a galaxy of shell entities based in tax havens    the caribbean  mauritius and the united arab emirates    controlled by the adani family   the adani group has previously been the focus of   major government fraud investigations which have alleged money laundering  theft of taxpayer funds and corruption  totaling an estimated u s      billion   hindenburg said    adani family members allegedly cooperated to create offshore shell entities in tax haven jurisdictions like mauritius  the uae  and caribbean islands  generating forged import export documentation in an apparent effort to generate fake or illegitimate turnover and to siphon money from the listed companies   the adani empire responded in two separate statements  one the day after the report was released and the other the following day  it rejects all these accusations and threatens to resort to the legal process to defend itself    the report is a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale  baseless and discredited allegations that have been tested and rejected by indias highest courts   commented jugeshinder singh  adani group s chief financial officer  in a statement on jan       the maliciously mischievous  unresearched report published by hindenburg research on    jan      has adversely affected the adani group  our shareholders and investors   said adani group s head of legal  jatin jalundhwala  in another statement on jan       we are deeply disturbed by this intentional and reckless attempt by a foreign entity to mislead the investor community and the general public  undermine the goodwill and reputation of the adani group and its leaders  and sabotage the  follow on public offering  from adani enterprises    we are evaluating the relevant provisions under us and indian laws for remedial and punitive action against hindenburg research   he continued  hindenburg is doubling down   regarding the company s threats of legal action  to be clear  we would welcome it   the short seller reacted   we fully stand by our report and believe any legal action taken against us would be meritless    if adani is serious  it should also file suit in the u s  where we operate  we have a long list of documents we would demand in a legal discovery process   in the meantime  adani companies are seeing a stock market rout  over the past two trading sessions  the adani empire has lost a total of     billion in market capitalization  according to bloomberg news   adani enterprises  the flagship of this empire  for example  lost nearly a fifth  more than      of its value on friday  units like adani green energy and adani total gas plunged      the daily limit allowed  adani power lost     adani ports share price dropped       and adani transmission fell         the sales of shares in adani related entities were widespread  with large trading volumes  the companies are listed on mumbai  friday s falls follow those of wednesday  the first session after hindenburg published its report  india s stock market was closed on thursday  jan      this stock market rout also affects gautam adani s fortune  according to bloomberg  this wealth should drop below      billion once the calculations are made by jan      it would be around     billion  at this level  adani would have lost about     billion of his fortune since the publication of the hindenburg report  the billionaire has left his lieutenants to manage the crisis for the moment  he continues to take care of his profile on the world stage  adani has published a photo of him with the egyptian president on jan       an honour to have met he president sisi and his ministers on his visit to india and hear from him about his ambitious development plans for egypt   the billionaire wrote on twitter   great possibilities in the ports and logistics  energy and digital sectors  we look forward to engaging   unsurprisingly  most twitter commentators were asking him to respond to the allegations of fraud made by hindenburg   it s good that you re flying high and spending the wings but do clarify the allegations by  hindenburgreport   commented one twitter user  last august  the creditsights subsidiary of fitch ratings warned that the adani conglomerate was  deeply overleveraged  and may  in the worst case scenario  spiral into a debt trap  but two weeks later the credit rating firm said it discovered that it had made  calculation errors  in two of adani group s companies  it corrected its report and removed the words  deeply overleveraged    creditsights  views have not changed from its original report and we still maintain that the group s leverage is elevated   creditsights concluded  adani group is one of the most valuable companies in india  the firm holds mines  ports and power plants  it owns a dozen commercial ports and is present in coal  electricity and renewable energy  it also has diversified into airports  data centers and defense  the company also recently entered the cement sector by buying assets of cement manufacturer holcim in india and is also looking to set up an aluminum factory   adani has grown the group by acquiring companies with debt  ,6857,Billionaire gautam adani has been caught up in what appears to be a nightmare the new

decline in q   productivity in the second quarter dropped another       says the bls  it was yet another blow for employers struggling to keep employees engaged  first  there was the  great resignation   and now there s quiet quitting  quiet quitting  a workplace trend that s been sweeping the nation  isnt necessarily about leaving your job  instead  it refers to simply doing the bare minimum  the term went viral on social media last year   particularly on tiktok  but will this trend continue in        hold onto your money   jeff bezos says you might want to rethink buying a  new

market you could be the landlord of walmart  whole foods and cvs  and collect fat grocery store anchored income on a quarterly basis  quiet quitting is in stark contrast to hustle culture   the  go getter  mentality that promotes consistently overperforming and exceeding expectations  although quiet quitting is a relatively new term  a large number of workers are doing it already  according to an august resumebuilder com survey of       working americans      of respondents say they only do the bare minimum  another    say they do even less than what theyre paid to do  and even if theyre not doing the bare minimum  people are definitely pulling back  one third of the surveys respondents say theyve reduced their weekly work hours by more than      for zaid khan  the    year old software developer and musician behind a popular tiktok video on the subject  its a matter of putting himself first   not his employer   overworking only gets you so far in corporate america   he says in an interview reported on by bloomberg   and like a lot of us have experienced in the past few years  mental and physical health really takes a backseat to productivity in a lot of these structured

says they need to feel  financially healthy   gen z requires a whopping     k year   but how do your own expectations compare  finding a balance between work and life is another big reason for the rise of quiet quitting   some employees no longer feel connected to their work or workplace and have a much stronger desire to focus their attention on their families and personal lives   says career strategist and coach stacie haller   with this shift in priorities  you see less willingness to engage in  hustle culture   and the feeling of being disconnected doesn t end there  a december survey from employee event planning company offsyte showed that over a third of workers surveyed said they felt disconnected from their coworkers  and     of employees said they feel like their manager doesnt listen to their concerns  the survey shows that possible lay offs and a lack of communication and transparency from their bosses were at the top of that list of concerns going into       of course  there are several obvious downsides to the quiet quitting trend  while acknowledging that people unhappy with their current job situation probably dont want to go above and beyond at work  haller says that quiet quitting  isnt productive    it would be better for disenchanted employees to speak with their managers about how to improve their current situation or to work with a job search coach to start looking for a more exciting opportunity   she suggests  and a fair percentage of employees do have aspirations of focusing on career growth and climbing the ladder this year  about     of respondents in the offsyte survey said they want to take on more responsibilities at their current employer and     said they want to learn new skill sets in       the surveys respondents also offered their employers some opportunities to reel them back in  almost half of employees said they want their employer to improve employee well being through things like mental health programs  and     of employees want employers to focus on team building activities to improve collaboration  so only time will tell if the trend of quiet quitting is here to stay or will fade away   quietly   momma

2023-01-28, when it comes to your retirement accounts  comparing how much you have saved with the national average can help you benchmark your savings    for most employees  an employer sponsored     k  account is a significant piece of their retirement planning  knowing how the balance in your     k  stacks up against the averages for your age range may inspire you to adjust your savings rate or perhaps choose different investments    a     k  is an employer sponsored retirement plan that offers tax savings to the employee  there are two types of     k s traditional and roth and they offer tax advantages in different ways    employees choose the percentage of their income that they want to contribute from their paychecks  up to government set annual maximums  the company may match some of the employee s contributions  the employee decides how to invest the money  typically  they choose from various mutual funds offered by the plan    a     k   especially one with an employer match  can be an ideal way to grow your retirement nest egg because of its tax advantages and the potential employer match    the internal revenue service  irs  sets yearly limits for how much employees can contribute to their     k  each year  for       workers can contribute up to         per year  those    and older may contribute an additional         for       the numbers rise to          plus an additional        for older workers    according to a recent report by vanguard  savings rates are increasing slightly  most likely due to automatic contribution plans  the average percentage contributed by employees for      was       and it was       when employer matches were factored in   not all employers match contributions     the overall average amount in a     k  account is

overall retirement savings picture  self employed people may invest in individual retirement accounts  iras  or taxable brokerage accounts  public employees and military personnel  among others  have their own employer sponsored retirement plans  and  of course  people with     k  accounts may have long term investments outside their employer sponsored plans   increasing your contribution by a single percentage every year can help you meet your retirement goals  consider investing a portion of any bonuses that you receive  too   financial needs in retirement vary widely based on the individual s circumstances and goals  but financial advisors often recommend saving enough to replace     of your current salary    if your balance is lower than you would like and youre not contributing the maximum to your account  you can take steps to catch up  first  make sure that youre contributing at least as much as your employer will match  this matching contribution is essentially free money    if your cash flow is tight  try to increase your contribution percentage incrementally as your salary increases  if youre close to retirement  remember that you can contribute more beginning at age    as a catch up contribution    you can also save outside of a     k   you can open a traditional or roth ira on your own with a bank or a credit union  you cannot contribute as much each year as you can with a     k   but you can get the same tax advantages  for       you can contribute         plus        if youre    or older  for       the maximum increases to         with the same        catch up contribution    finally  you can invest extra funds in a traditional brokerage account  you won t get the same tax advantages  but you can increase your retirement funds   not all employers offer a     k  match  but many do  it s a particularly powerful job incentive  employers who match contributions set a limit on their contributions  often equalling    to    of the employee s salary  they generally impose a vesting period of several years before the full match is available  so if you change jobs you can lose some of that match  there is a limit to how much you can contribute each year to a     k   there are also limits to how much your employer can contribute  for       total contributions  including your own and your employer s  cannot exceed         per year  if youre age    or older  the total increases to          in       the total combined contribution limits are          or         for employees over age     you can withdraw from your traditional     k  after age     for any reason without having to pay early withdrawal penalties  you can withdraw the money earlier without penalty for certain exceptions  you can withdraw your contributions from your roth     k  at any time with no penalty  but you must pay taxes and potential penalties on earnings if you withdraw them early   if youre behind in retirement savings compared with the average in your age group  consider increasing your contributions  think of your     k  as one tool in your retirement toolbox  in combination with iras  taxable brokerage

inflation was at       and unemployment hit     the federal reserve hiked its federal funds rate to a whopping      for comparison  its currently at       to         the high interest rate made getting ahead almost impossible  says mike drak  who was a banker at the time  he remembers his mortgage rate was       at the time   rates were going up  it was almost monthly  they were increasing   drak says   so it seemed like it was something that that didn t seem like it was ever going to stop  and i remember saying at one point   if i could ever find one day where i could find a mortgage rate for      i d be the happiest person in the world   drak is the author of victory lap retirement and retirement heaven or hell  which will you choose and a senior contributor at booming encore  a finance blog focused on the baby boomer generation  debt at that time rose quickly  says drak   on houses  on credit cards and on vehicles   it was tough  scary times  but we were lucky because we could work  so our wages kept increasing   not at the same pace   but it necessitated both people working to help pay down debt   one of the most important things you can do during times of high interest is pay down debt  he says  his goal at the time was to pay down his mortgage  which wasnt easy   you have to have a lot of discipline  you d have to say i want to make lump sum additions

lyons suggests people stay away from credit card debt especially   pay off debt as much as  you  can  to the extent that  youre  able to do so   he said  paying down debt  especially now  might sound daunting  but there are a couple different tactics you can use  like the avalanche method and the snowball method  as tempting as it is to take out money from your investment accounts  especially as you watch numbers take a dive  lyons cautions not to give in to that temptation   during periods where you have decreased valuations in the stock markets  nobody likes to see their valuations in their accounts go down  their retirement plan accounts that they have become accustomed to seeing going up and up and up year after year after year   lyons says   and now they re seeing it go down some  but it s going to come back over time   for younger generations  he says  this is an opportunity to invest at a lower price  if you can afford it   what we re suggesting is that people remain invested  maintain their asset allocation that was designed in order to achieve their goals and objectives in the timeframes that they have set for themselves and continue to add to their investment portfolio through their retirement account savings   dollar cost averaging is one of the most trusted strategies  its investing the same amount of money at regular intervals  regardless of what the market is doing   by taking advantage of lower valuations youre effectively buying more shares at a lower price   says lyons  although it can be hard when every trip to the grocery store is costing you more  and the price of everything is going up  both drak and lyons say saving is hugely important  and it can also be advantageous   as interest rates continue to rise  we will begin to see interest rates higher in our savings accounts  and newly issued fixed income securities   says lyons  if you stick your money in a high yield savings account  its going to grow faster than it would have even just at the beginning of this year  and although that probably wont keep pace with current inflation  it helps to build a safety net  the     s was a long decade  there were two recessions and it was years before inflation was under control and interest rates began to drop  and although our current situation is a little different  if theres anything to be learned from the past  its that inflation and higher interest rates will be here for a while yet   bear down   drak tells younger generations going through a similar financial landscape   try to work as hard as  you  can and make as much money as  you  can  and be as frugal as  you  can  that s the key  and there s no way around it  you have to be prudent  you have to pull back and you have to watch your pennies   the us dollar has lost     of

How much do I really need to retire? Fidelity wants you to save 10 times your income by age 67. But here are 3 reasons why that could be dead wrong,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-really-retire-fidelity-wants-140000364.html,     2023-01-28,everybody craves a benchmark  they give us guidance  a target  an easily understood standard  so its little wonder that one of the most popular financial google searches is some variation of this question  how much money will i need in retirement  for many people  retirement is simultaneously a bonanza of free time  full of travel  hobbies and passionate pursuits  but once you leave that full time job behind   along with the     k  employer match  health insurance and other benefits   here come the sobering snags  medical care  rising costs for everything  and a nest egg eaten away by required minimum distributions  taxes and even market slumps  what may be surprising  however  is that a popular recent answer to that retirement amount question   fidelity investments counsel to sock away    times your current annual income by age      may be one of the most misleading pieces of advice on the retirement web  lets explore why the    times rule may be no good rule at all  you could be the landlord of walmart  whole foods and cvs  and collect

retirement planning for clients  but some financial experts believe fidelitys    times guidance undershoots the real cost of retirement  financial consultant grant cardone recently wrote in a linkedin post that inflation and the risk of unplanned emergency spending   like a catastrophic health event or emerging condition   could mean that target falls short  not only would that leave you exposed  it could undermine the feeling of financial independence we all want in retirement  inflation and health costs are among the expenses that shock retirees who simply arent saving enough  cardone said   i know the idea that  a million dollars isnt enough to retire on is hard to swallow   he wrote   but your opinion doesnt change the reality  a million dollars is simply not what it used to be   health expenses alone should have many folks writing their plans in pencil  not pen  consider fidelitys own      guidance that a retiring    year old american couple can expect to spend          on medical and health expenses in retirement  a    jump over       read more  here s how much the average american    year old holds in retirement savings   how does your nest egg compare  two key variables offer intriguing counters to cardone  first  how much are you willing to save at the expense of enjoying your more mobile years  first  consider that the vast majority of retirement advice hinges on what youre doing today to plan and fund tomorrow  of course thats a sound outlook  but is there too much of a good thing  consider cardones advice to go beyond   perhaps way beyond   fidelitys guidance  using a retirement calculator  a    year old making          a year  with          in their     k  and who plans to retire at     would have to save at least        a month   or nearly     of their income   to reach a nest egg of about      million  that amount exceeds fidelitys guidance  and some folks might be able to sock that much away  or more  but for many  that level of investment could affect their quality of life in pre retirement and leave precious little left after bills and other obligations are met  another variable is the notion of how your priorities will affect your anticipated spending  will you spend those first few years of retirement traveling the globe  then yes  fidelitys figure may be low when you factor the cost of that travel plus all of lifes expected expenses as you age  its also possible your needs  and costs  may diminish in retirement  you may find you have to choose volunteerism over non stop travel  home cooking over eating out  or athletic or artistic hobbies over expensive cars  but with those steps  suddenly youll find theres a way better chance your   or even   times savings will go the distance for you   hold onto your

Who gives the best retirement advice? Suze Orman and Dave Ramsey or economists?,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/who-gives-the-best-retirement-advice-popular-authors-or-economists-11674759017?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo,     2023-01-28,millions of people get their financial advice from non economists  personal finance authors such as robert kiyosaki  author of the bestselling book   rich dad poor dad   which has sold    million copies since       dave ramsey  author of  total money makeover   and suze orman  author of  the money book for the young    fabulous   broke    women   money  and  the   steps to financial freedom   read  suze orman says  most of america today has absolutely no money  heres where the guru is putting her funds  and in those and other books of that ilk  the authors write about the importance of starting to save immediately  the magic of compound interest  and the need to build an emergency fund  in fact  these authors advise readers to continue saving at a high rate even after an adequate emergency savings fund has been established  consider his book   money  master the game   tony robbins wrote   whatever that  savings percentage  number is  youve got to stick to it  in good times and bad  no matter what  why  because the laws of compounding punish even one missed contribution   but this advice about not just savings rates  but also asset allocation  using a fixed versus adjustable rate mortgage  managing nonmortgage debt and spending in retirement  often deviates from economists advice   according to james choi  a yale university professor  who recently reviewed    personal finance books and compared it to the prescriptions of normative economic models   read  popular personal financial advice versus the professors  to be fair  popular financial advice may be more practically useful to the ordinary individual  according to choi  in fact  the authors of such books get two things right relative to economic theory  according to choi  one  the actions they recommend are often easily computable by ordinary individuals  and two  the advice offered takes into account difficulties individuals have in executing a financial plan due to  say  limited motivation or emotional reactions to circumstances   but  he also noted   the advice deviates from normative economic theory because of fallacies   and  as a result  theres a considerable gap between theory and practice   consider what the professors say versus what the popular personal finance authors have to say about saving for retirement  asset allocation  and retirement income   how much to save for retirement  when it comes to saving money  economists favor what the life cycle hypothesis recommends   it says when youre young and your income is low relative to your lifetime income  you should not be saving all that much because you want to have a relatively consistent path of consumption over time   said choi in an interview   save relatively very little when youre young  save a lot when youre mid age  and then draw down as you enter your retirement years    but thats not what the authors of personal finance books recommend   the popular authors have a pretty different conception   said choi   their advice  save     to     of income regardless of age and circumstances during your working years   they think you should be smoothing out your savings rate rather than your consumption rate   said choi   you have to establish the discipline  you have to become the type of person who saves and just saves consistently  and then the power of compound interest is going to make everyone a millionaire if only they can forgo a latte a day    theres truth to that  but the life cycle model takes all that into account  choi said   so even with the power of compound interest  you shouldnt be saving so much when youre young   he said   in fact  the optimal savings rate  according to choi  is whatever the difference happens to be between income and optimal consumption  and not surprisingly  he also notes that the common policy of making the default retirement savings plan contribution rate not dependent on age is suboptimal   read  many young people shouldnt save for retirement  says research based on a nobel prize winning theory    what gives  why the difference between theory and practice  is it because personal finance authors dont understand economics  not necessarily  said choi  its more a function of focus  economists  he said  are focused on utility  and utility comes from consuming   you want to maximize the total happiness you get from consuming over time   he said   and the popular authors dont really think that way at all  its just not part of their paradigm    their paradigm is more that saving is a virtue  that its important to establish saving consistently as a discipline and take advantage of the power of compound interest  and quite frankly  notes choi  the need to create the discipline of saving is  almost always missing from economic models of optimal saving a potentially important oversight    whats the right asset allocation   personal finance authors and economists land in the same place when it comes to asset allocation but for different reasons  for instance  the investment horizon is of paramount concern for personal financial authors  the longer your investment horizon  they say  the greater your allocation to equities could be  in fact  some of the authors recommend that investors use the  percent of the portfolio in stocks should be     minus your age  rule   think target date funds     whats more  the personal finance authors are fond of suggesting that stocks get less risky over time    for economists  however  its not the investment horizon that dictates asset allocation  rather future income is the dominant consideration    for someone who is young  who has a lot of labor income remaining in their future  they can afford to take a lot of risks in their financial portfolio   he said   then they need to scale back that risk when they get older and they dont have that much labor income remaining in their life  in which case they need to be more conservative in their financial portfolio because they dont have that labor income buffer    thus  personal finance authors and economists might suggest that a    something allocates     of their portfolio in stocks and     in bonds  the authors would suggest that asset allocation given the multi decade time horizon  while the economists would suggest that asset allocation because the    something needs to incorporate their future income  their human capital  into the investment portfolio  the future income represents the fixed income allocation and stocks would then represent the larger share of the investment portfolio    for most of us  our labor income is not hugely tied to the stock market and you can think of it as a pretty safe asset   said choi   managing longevity risk     rule vs  an annuity  when it comes to generating income in retirement and managing the risk of outliving assets  the personal finance authors recommend an entirely different approach from economists  the economists recommend either fully annuitizing ones wealth in retirement or  if not  an aggressive drawdown strategy  the personal finance authors  meanwhile  advise against annuitizing and instead recommend a fixed drawdown rate  say    of assets adjusted for inflation each year    annuitizing just isnt on their radar screen   said choi    the personal finance authors note  for instance  that annuities dont mitigate the risk of inflation  or that annuity contract owners might die early  or that annuity contract owners give up control of their money   but for economists  the dominant consideration is that you cant take it  your nest egg  with you   said choi   once youre dead  you cant take it with you  once youre dead  that money is no good to you    the great thing about life annuities  he said  is that the contract owners who die early subsidize the people who will live a long time   the people who are still alive are the ones who need the money  not the people whove already died   choi said   and if you die young  the financial losses are the least of your worries    for people who want to leave a bequest to their heirs  choi suggests carving out a portion of ones assets for that and annuitizing the rest  that way youre de risking your portfolio   but people just dont seem to think that way   he said   youre putting a lot of risk on your heirs when you dont annuitize and say anything thats left over will go to them  according to choi  why so  well  if you live for a long time  then your heirs inheritance is going to be relatively small  and if you die too soon  their inheritance is going to be relatively large   drawing down assets as for drawing down assets  the personal finance authors recommend spending to keep ones real level of wealth roughly constant in retirement  but economists take an entirely different perspective   you cant take the money with you   he said   whyd you save all this money over your lifetime  its so that you can spend it down when youre retired and when youre on your deathbed  at least in the economist framework  you want to spend the last penny that you got and then die a second after that    but the popular authors seem to be oriented around  preserving ones principle indefinitely   said choi   of course  dying broke is easier said than done  no one knows their date of death   the economists solution is to buy an annuity   he said   then you dont have to worry about this stuff    if youre not going to buy an annuity  then the economic model says you should be  dissaving  over time  said choi   you should be worth less financially when youre    years old than when youre    years old   that would mean not just withdrawing    per year but increasing that percentage over time   if youre    and youre still drawing down only     you could probably afford to spend more at that point  you should be spending more today because tomorrow may never come    yes  he admits  that makes people nervous   theyre nervous that they are going to run out of money   he said   but if youre nervous youre going to run out of money  buy an annuity    the right book   does choi recommend that savers and investors read any of the books he reviewed  was one better than all the rest  in short  the answer was no  in fact  he  fundamentally disagreed  with the advice being delivered in every single book   choi did  however  say that he teaches a personal finance course at yale university  and in that course  he uses personal finance for dummies by eric tyson as the textbook   despite the title i find it to be a surprisingly good book   he said  there is  of course  plenty in the book that he disagrees with  but  he said  theres much in the book thats  fairly reasonable    nationally  retirees would need an average nest egg of       million  robert powell writes about retirement issues  follow bob on twitter   retirementpedia   robert powell writes about retirement issues  follow bob on

2 LiDAR Stocks Under $10 With Over 100% Upside Potential; J.P. Morgan Says ‘Buy’,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-lidar-stocks-under-10-142644768.html,     2023-01-28,every so often  some technological advance comes along that forever alters the world we live in  henry fords assembly line brought cars to the masses  the internet has changed the way we communicate  and mobile devices have taken those changes to a new level  improvements in all three of those areas  the automotive  computing  and networking sectors  are coming together now  and will bring enormous change to the inner workings of our cars  one of those coming changes is already starting to appear  lidar technology   light detection and ranging   is a sensor technology  offering improvements in vehicle safety and navigation systems  by way of driver assistance  and bring the needed sensitivity to make autonomous vehicles possible  last year  the global auto industry demand for lidar reached      million  thats expected to grow to more than      billion by end of this decade  for a compound annual growth rate of     or higher  few industries offer that kind of growth potential  and investors should take note  against this backdrop  jpmorgan   star analyst samik chatterjee has taken an in depth look at the lidar market  and has tapped two stocks as potential winners in this expanding field  they both offer investors a low cost of entry  under     per share  and according to chatterjee  they boast triple digit upside potential  running the tickers through the tipranks database  its clear chatterjee is not alone in thinking these stocks have plenty to offer investors  both are also rated as strong buys by the analyst consensus  innoviz technologies ltd   invz  well start with innoviz  a leader in the design and manufacture of high end  solid state lidar sensors  and the perception software needed to make sense of what the sensor  sees  innoviz offers several lidar packages  and its flagship products  innovizone and innoviztwo  are specifically designed for automotive use  innoviz was selected by bmw to partner in the mass production of level     autonomous vehicles  giving it a major outlet for its lidar sensor systems  while innoviz deal with bmw gives it an opening with a premier auto maker  the company has not stopped looking for outlets and partnerships  earlier this month  innoviz announced two such deals  one  with swiss based loxo  is for the provision of lidar sensors to enable autonomous driving in a fleet of all electric delivery vehicles  the other  with the french company exwayz  is to integrate the innovizone lidar system into a variety of non automotive applications  innoviz is expanding  and to accommodate its growth  the company moved to a new headquarters facility during  q    that move caused a run of downtime in the production lines  and a consequent drop in revenue for the quarter  in the  q   report  the last quarterly results released  the company had a top line of just       million  falling significantly from the      million recorded in  q   and missing the consensus forecast of       million  the company expects to see revenues normalize in q   for which results are expected in early march  on a positive note for the company  innoviz reported having      million in cash holdings at the end of q   pockets deep enough to get it through a rough spot  covering innoviz for j p  morgan  chatterjee sees plenty of potential for investors to grab onto  he writes   the company is following up early wins in automotive  bmw  and a shuttle program with big volumes win  with vw  and a non traditional auto oem  asia oem and ev   setting it up for the largest order book in pure play public lidar companies at this time    additionally  we also expect the pace of wins with existing and potentially new customer engagements to accelerate following the validation with two major auto oems  we expect the combination of numerous wins  large volume wins  balance of lidar costs and performance and ability to support highway autonomy at high speeds to position innoviz to ramp revenues well through the end of the decade  while cost discipline should drive profitability   the analyst added  acknowledging the companys potential growth  chatterjee rates invz shares an overweight  i e  buy   and his     price target suggests a robust one year upside of         to watch chatterjees track record  click here  overall  wall streets analysts have published   recent reviews on innoviz stock  which include   buys and   hold for a strong buy consensus rating  the stocks current share price is        and its     average price target indicates a gain of       lying ahead for this innovative company   see innoviz stock forecast  luminar technologies  inc   lazr  the second stock well look at  luminar technologies  is a florida based firm that also maintains a major presence in silicon valley  the company is developing cutting edge lidar and machine perception technology  mainly for use in the automotive sector  luminars product lines are designed to integrate sensors with ai  giving cars autonomous safety features to support a human driver  the systems will also help drivers navigate in dark conditions or on winding roads  luminar currently has two major products in production  iris and sentinel  both are built from the chips up  and designed to integrate lidar vision sensors into new vehicles from the early stages of assembly  the companys products can scale to small compact cars or to commercial trucks  luminar currently works with multiple global commercial partners  including a majority of oems in the automotive sector  for both consumer and commercial vehicles  this is a tech segment that is still ramping up  and luminars revenues are correspondingly modest  long term  however  the company has been showing a trend toward an increasing top line  the last reported quarter was  q    when luminar brought in       million in revenue  compared to    million in the prior year quarter  the company maintained its full year revenue guidance of     to     million  it will report q  and full year      results in march  so well see then how it measures up to that outlook  in the meantime  jpms chatterjee is impressed with this company  setting out why he sees lazr stock growing going forward  he writes   luminar  is  positioned not only as an industry leader in relation to lidar technology  but also more broadly in relation to autonomous driving technology  we see a differentiated position through   key aspects including     performance of the forward facing lidar designed using custom engineered and manufactured components     software investments which will enable luminar to participate in the large addressable market relative to the software stack for autonomous vehicles   based on the above  its no wonder chatterjee rates lazr shares an overweight  i e  buy   with a price tag of      the analyst believes shares could surge      in the next twelve months  chatterjees bullish view is one of   recent analyst reviews on this stock   including among them   buys and   holds to support a strong buy consensus  the shares are trading for       and have an average price target of         giving lazr a      one year upside potential   see luminar stock forecast  to find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations  visit tipranks

Why are my investments in a rut? That’s the way Wall Street wants it.,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/investments-in-a-rut-maybe-its-the-wall-street-industrial-complex-11674773218?siteid=yhoof2&yptr=yahoo,     2023-01-28,the wall street establishment doesnt want you to read this article  and ill tell you why  if youre an investor and not getting all the returns you deserve  there are lots of possible reasons  perhaps the biggest one is that wall street likes it that way   giant firms like goldman sachs          gs                         blackrock          blk                         morgan stanley          ms                        and jpmorgan chase          jpm                        routinely make billions of dollars in annual profits  and thats after routinely paying their armies of salespeople mid  to high six figure salaries plus bonuses  from your point of view  the returns you achieve are equal to whats left over after wall street takes its cut in the forms of expenses  sales commissions  hidden costs  and more   read  a  humbling for david solomon  economist refers to his investment bank as  goldman sags in cover story  but from wall streets point of view  the more you keep  the less is left for brokers  traders  sales people  marketing people  advertising agencies  executives  corporate jets  sales incentives  and other  essential  tools of the trade    yes  the overall stock market          spx                        had a dismal time of it last year  and thats not the fault of the investment banks  insurance companies  brokerage houses  financial media  mutual fund companies  independent advisers and various online gurus and services that collectively make up what i refer to as wall street  this industry doesnt make the market go up and down    however  wall street is riddled with conflicts of interest and populated with smiling people who will do virtually anything to attract assets they can manage   beat the market  once they get their hands on our money  their greatest desire is to convince us they can help us beat the market and  do better than the other guy   if they can do that  theyll likely keep our business and get referrals too  yet its ironic  unfair  and heartbreakingly expensive for millions of investors  that wall street doesnt promote a simple product that virtually guarantees above average returns  the index fund   the index fund as we know it today gives individuals an easy and inexpensive way to own a slice of everything thats in  the market   this is very good news for us as investors  but from wall streets point of view  index funds have a serious problem  they let investors keep too much of their gains  to keep investors away from index funds  wall street promotes recent performance  hotshot managers and expensive  high risk products that theoretically could produce high returns for investors but are guaranteed to generate hefty short term sales commissions for advisers and ample profits for the companies that produce them  the cost of all this can easily exceed    per year  for many investors  that can add up to millions of dollars over a lifetime   recent performance if your job is to sell investment products and collect assets for your employer to manage  your surest and easiest ticket to success is to focus your sales presentations on recent performance   your customers want you to connect them with winners  and if a particular fund has been outperforming its peers in the most recent decade  calendar year or six month period  you as a salesperson can choose whatever data seems most impressive   youve found what your customers want  is it the best choice for them  well  thats not really your problem  is it   however  if you are the investor  you might want to listen to john bogle  the founder of vanguard  who wrote that buying funds based primarily on their past performance  especially only recent performance   is one of the stupidest things an investor can do   getting smart  as i said  wall street wont be happy that youre reading this  in my      book  get smart or get screwed  i describe how wall streets salespeople are taught to deceive investors while staying barely within the limits of the securities laws  read your free copy here  its only natural to think this couldnt apply to your own adviser  after all  successful salespeople  including brokers  are usually courteous  respectful and likable  the sort of people you would want for friends   however  the people you deal with do not work in isolation  they are part of a highly organized and sophisticated industry  stuck in a system that works against the client in various ways  my criticisms are aimed at the system  not the individuals who have found they can make a living inside it   in a chapter called  get screwed through sales pressure   i discussed one of the primary drivers of the whole business  how much peace of mind would you get from a medical system that paid doctors a commission for every prescription they wrote  sales pressure can lead to churning accounts through frequent purchases and sales with no apparent purpose other than to generate trades  it also favors high risk  high commission products  i talked to a broker whose firm was underwriting a new stock offering that he thought was too risky for his clients  when he complained about having to sell a quota of the stock  his boss told him that whatever he didnt sell  he would have to buy for himself  conflicts of interest  in this book  i also described how an insurance company representative once invited me to help create a new investment  when i protested that his proposal would cost so much that it would be a poor choice for investors  he replied   that wont be a problem  if you put a big enough commission on something  the salespeople will sell anything   i passed on the opportunity    all is not lost  you can avoid most of this  if not all of it  but in order to do that  you have to take charge of your investments  your best bet is to educate yourself as much as possible  maintain reasonable expectations  and do the right things        keep your expenses and portfolio turnover low        diversify massively        dont try to beat the market          pay attention to taxes  finally  if you work with an investment adviser  choose one who has a legal fiduciary responsibility to resolve any

robust cash flow earmarked for  acquisitions   but as total covid    revenues erode there is less available  and at a time where new product growth looks less certain   they wrote    pfizer would

My Bank Closed My Account. What Do I Do Now?,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-closed-account-now-140024229.html,     2023-01-28,having a bank account closed can be inconvenient  especially if you didnt see it coming  but why would a bank close your account  the short answer is that banks and credit unions can close accounts for a number of reasons  understanding why a bank account could be shut down can help you avoid an unpleasant financial situation  a financial advisor can walk you through different banking options for you financial plan  why would a bank close your account  banks can choose to close accounts for different reasons  though some might be more common than others  here are six common situations when a bank might close your account  inactivity  you might open a new bank account intending to switch funds over from your current bank  or maybe you just opened a new checking or savings account to take advantage of an introductory bonus  if you fail to make your initial deposit by a certain date or theres no activity on the account within a specific window of time the bank could close your account  negative balance  when a bank account has a negative balance  it means you dont have any funds available to spend  youd need to make a deposit to bring your account balance positive again  banks may close your account if you have a negative balance and show no signs of making a deposit to rectify it  excess overdrafts  overdrafts occur when debit transactions exceed your available balance  leaving you with a negative balance  most banks charge overdraft fees when that occurs  which could put your account even deeper into the red  if overdraft fees are piling up  the bank might close your account to keep you from completing new transactions  bounced checks  bouncing a check means you dont have enough money in your account to cover the amount  banks may shut down accounts that have a history of writing bad checks or of accepting bad checks for deposit and drawing against the funds  fraud  banks may sometimes close an account if they suspect fraud  for example  the bank might freeze your account if they believe that someone is attempting to use your information to make unauthorized purchases or withdrawals  banks can also close accounts if they believe the account owner is engaging in fraud or criminal activity  such as money laundering  policy violations  your bank account could be closed if your bank believes youve violated one or more of its policies  for example  if the bank has a set policy on daily atm withdrawal limits and they find that youre repeatedly trying to get around those limits  it might close your account  can a bank legally close your account without your permission  banks and credit unions can close accounts without the permission of the account owner  depending on where you live  state law may require the bank or credit union to notify you in advance  but the bank doesnt have to ask if its okay to close your account  what happens if a bank closes your account  do you lose the money in your account  the good news is that if a bank closes your account  its obligated to return the money in the account to you less any fees or account closing charges that might apply  say you deposit      into a new checking account but six months later  you havent used it  the bank could close your account for inactivity and charge a     fee  then pay the remaining      back to you  payment typically arrives in the form of a check mailed to the address you have on file  now  what if the bank closes your account with a negative balance  in that case  youd have to make a deposit to bring the balance back to zero  otherwise  youd owe money to the bank and your account could be reported to chexsystems  chexsystems is a consumer reporting agency that collects information related to bank account closures  having a negative mark on your chexsystems report can make it more difficult to open new accounts at a different bank  can a closed bank account be reopened  whether you can reopen a closed bank account can depend on the circumstances  if you closed the account yourself  then reopening the account may be as simple as asking your bank to make it active again  if the bank closed your account  youd first have to understand the reason for the closure  for example  if the bank closed your account because of suspected fraud but you can
